    "question": "Question on thermal conductance in general and in regards to a atto3DR: How good (or poor) is the thermal conductivity through the attocube stack? Does it differ much between Ti & CuBe?",
    "answer": "In vacum there is basically no thermalisation of the sample holder through the stack. The metallic pieces of the positioners are separated by the piezo elements which have very poor thermal conductance. For this reason an ATC is needed. Like we do in the attodry 800. Depending on what the customer wants to measure, sometimes cooling well the sample holder is not so relevant, provided the electrical wires going to the sample are well thermalised. Still, better to use an ATC. The material of the positioners makes a difference more on the general stability of the stack due to thermal contraction and the time needed to reach base T, than to which temperature the sample will reach. CuBe is better than Ti because Ti enters a superconducting phase at mK temperatures, thus does not conduct well heat. CuBe stays a good heat conductor, still with the caveat above. When customer don’t want to buy CuBe and don’t care about Ti becoming superconducting (even though little milliTesla of magnetic field are enough to break this) , we build Ti-posis in DR without problems, eventually using some extra thermalisation foils",

    "answer": "For older stages before March 2021 when switching to PEEK connectors at all AN* POS and SCN the main differences between the /LT and the /LT/HV positioners are different materials in the wiring and connectors, different materials used in the lubrication, glue, different clamping forces on the guiding rod and additional testing for the LT/HV versions.\n\nWe specify the standard low temperature (/LT) version to operate in a pressure range from 1E-4 mbar to ambient pressure, whereas the low temperature/high vacuum (/LT/HV) extends this range down to 1E-8mbar. As the general applicability, we recommend customers to use the standard /LT version if they operate at a pressure higher than 1E-4 mbar before cooling down, even though the cryogenic pressure will be significantly smaller (since outgassing is not an issue at low temperature, the /LT positioner will not worsen the overall pressure). If customers want to achieve high vacuum conditions already at room temperature prior to cool down, then the /LT/HV version is more appropriate.",

Also, the step size differs for the forward and backward motions due to the properties of the piezo.

At this point one solution is to use the stages at mK in a way that individual steps and DC offset (if needed) are applied, and then you would have to wait until the temperature and hence the position readout stabilizes again. Another possible immediate solution would be to position the stages at more elevated temperatures (e.g. at 4K), ground the stages and then cool down to mK temperatures. The reading of the encoder will still change due to the temperature dependency of the resistive sensor element, but if the controller is not trying to compensate for this “alleged” drift in position the stage will actually remain at the same position as positioned at 4K. For mK applications (or better all applications below 1 or 2 K) the /RES+ encoder is recommended.",

In this mode the positioners have a travel range of several mm (up to 50 mm for the ECS3080 for example). 2) fine-positioning: for this mode we apply a DC voltage which now simply expands the piezo. In this mode the range is limited, e.g. 3.5 µm for the ANPx101 @RT. Within this range you can get sub-nm resolution which is only limited by the noise of the electronics.",

The thermal expansion coefficient for a piezo is in the order of 5E-6/K for 300 K and ~4E-3/K for cryogenic environments. Therefore, one can say that minimum changes (especially in ambient conditions) are negligible whereas the cooling down to cryogenic temperatures causes larger (but reproducible) changes in the position.\n\nThe respective creep specifications can be found in the spec sheets (e.g. ANSz100: creep = 0.5.. 0.8% per decade of time).",

    "answer": "In principle we cannot give any guarantee for our systems when they are directly immersed into liquid Helium. We do have a lot of customers who are successfully using our positioners in liquid Helium, but then it is very important to avoid condensation and ice on the positioners. Condensed ice will reduce the specs of the operation and worse, in the long run when ice melts into water this will oxidize contacts and affect components as well as piezos (current leakage etc.). In case condensation occurs on the positioners we would recommend that after every warm up cycle the remaining fluid is evaporated (e.g. in an oven with a max. temperature of 100°C) before cooling down again.\nAs you see there are too many parameters outside our control and hence we cannot provide a full guarantee. However we know that customers have been using our equipment directly in liquid Helium for several years now and we don’t have any reports on the degradation of our equipment due to the environmental conditions.",
