How does the grease affect the vacuum compatibility of the EC* positioners?;"UHV versions of the rotators and goniometers of our EC*-Series are only specified down to 10-9 mbar and not down to 10-11 mbar as the linear ECS positioners. The limitation is caused by the used grease (Ultratherm). It is not possible built up an ECR without grease. The vapor pressure of the grease is temperature-dependent:

Vapor pressure at 100°C :1 · 10-8 hPa / 7.5 · 10-9 Torr / 1 · 10-8 mbar
Vapor pressure at 20°C :1 · 10-12 hPa / 7.5 · 10-13 Torr / 1 · 10-12 mbar

"What is the definition of ""wobble""?	";Wobble is the position-dependent angular misalignment of the real axis of rotation relative to its ideal axis. Wobble is often cyclic in nature and is caused by the imperfect nature of mechanical components. It is defined for one full rotation (360°) and does not include any static offset of the rotating axis to an interface or mounting plate. ;Public;5050hs;
"How is the ""wobble"" of a rotator measured?	";"The ECR/NUM series has been tested with our testbench""Randy"" over the last years.

This will be tested as part of outgoing quality control, the specifications listed below already include a factory of saftey. Please note that we are only able to test and specify closed loop (/NUM) versions.


This is based on having 3 sensor heads, mounted along a fixed XYZ coordinate system above the rotator, measuring the Z component deviations during the rotation. With the values of two out of these 3 sensor heads we get the pitch value and the roll value respectively, as well as the hight deviation along Z from all 3 sensor heads. The result is a measurement as shown in the screenshot on the right.";Semi-internal;5050hs;

"How can you determine the power consumption of an AMC Controller?	";"Theory:

The formular to compute the power usage per controller (consisting of 3 axis each) is:

PAMC300 = 18 W + (Ua1² × f1 × C1) + (Ua2² × f2 × C2) + (Ua3² × f3 × C3)

PAMC100 = 8 W + (Ua1² × f1 × C1) + (Ua2² × f2 × C2) + (Ua3² × f3 × C3)


There is about 18 W of idle state power consumption per AMC300 board (for AMC100 board onyl 5-8 W).
Additionally, there is a necessary amount of power per axis (1 to 3) that drives the attached positioner, which is determined by the formula Ua² * f * C . Here, Ua  denotes the driving voltage,f the driving frequency and C the attached piezo capacitance, which depends on the connected positioner.";Public;AMC;"Example:

As an example, consider the following positioners simultaneously run by an AMC300:

ECR5050hs/AL/NUM/RT à C = 720 nF
ECGt5050/Al/NUM/RT à C = 1110 nF
ECGp5050/Al/NUM/RT à C = 1110 nF
Also, consider an exemplary standard setting across all axes of

driving voltage:       Ua1-3 = 40 V
driving frequency:  f1-3 = 1000 Hz  
With the above values, the formula for the power consumption returns:

P = 18 W + (40 V * 40 V * 1000 Hz * 720 nF) + (40 V * 40 V * 1000 Hz * 1110 nF) + (40 V * 40 V * 1000 Hz * 1110 nF) = 5 W + 1.15 W + 1.77 W + 1.77 W = 22.69 W

--> Thus, the power consumption amounts to about 23 W for this board when driving the 3 positioners simultaneously."

Moreover, the cernox sensor is more accurate as well as suitable for magnetic fields (looking at our future (magnet option) we see a higher benefit in those sensors). Furthermore, everyone should be aware that more articles lead to more costs (e.g. storage and maintenance costs) and just overcomplicate a few things and processes.

"Question on thermal conductance in general and in regards to a atto3DR: How good (or poor) is the thermal conductivity through the attocube stack? Does it differ much between Ti & CuBe?	";"In vacum there is basically no thermalisation of the sample holder through the stack. The metallic pieces of the positioners are separated by the piezo elements which have very poor thermal conductance. For this reason an ATC is needed. Like we do in the attodry 800. Depending on what the customer wants to measure, sometimes cooling well the sample holder is not so relevant, provided the electrical wires going to the sample are well thermalised. Still, better to use an ATC. The material of the positioners makes a difference more on the general stability of the stack due to thermal contraction and the time needed to reach base T, than to which temperature the sample will reach. CuBe is better than Ti because Ti enters a superconducting phase at mK temperatures, thus does not conduct well heat. CuBe stays a good heat conductor, still with the caveat above. When customer don’t want to buy CuBe and don’t care about Ti becoming superconducting (even though little milliTesla of magnetic field are enough to break this) , we build Ti-posis in DR without problems, eventually using some extra thermalisation foils

Do you have information about the thermal conductivity of your CuBe and Titanium products? ;"How do they compare at low (4K) and ultra-low tmeperature (e.g. 12 mK)? Is the CuBe option going to transport heat more efficiently towards the floor of the sample space?

ANS:We are using titanium grade 2 (unalloyed titanium), which is supposed to have about the same thermal conductivity as CuBe.

As titanium gets superconducting at T < 400 mK its thermal conductivity is much lower at mK temperature than that of CuBe. We therefore advise customers working at these temperatures to go fur CuBe.

At T < 400 mK heat transport in titanium is strongly suppressed due to its superconducting phase. We therefore strongly recommend CuBe as otherwise it may take a while to cool down a set of positioners. Furthermore you will get eddy currents when applying small magnetic fields so you won't get a clean magnetic measurement around 0 T B-field.

At T > 400 mK there is probably little difference between the two materials. Please keep in mind that heat transport is also blocked by the ceramic axes used in attocubes Premium Line positioners.

The heat capacity at room temp is a factor of 2 higher and the thermal conductivity a factor of 4 higher for Cu-Be than grade 5 titanium. Do you know how they compare at low (4K) and ultra-low temperature like 12mK?
Is the Cu-Be option going to transport heat more efficiently towards the floor of the sample space?

Original Ans: 
Answer SF (27.04.2017):
We are using titanium grade 2 which is unalloyed titanium. This NIST-publication mentions titanium grade 5 which is alloyed with aluminum and vanadium:
http://cryogenics.nist.gov/Papers/Cryo Materials.pdf
Thermal conductivity of Cube is significantly higher even though titanium (grade 5) has only be measured down to 20K. Grade 2 titanium is supposed to have more than twice the thermal conductivity than grade 5 (Wikipedia), so our titanium and our Cube should have about the same thermal conductivity.
As titanium gets superconducting at T<400mK its thermal conductivity is much lower at mk temperatre than that of Cube. We therefore advise customers working at these temperatures to go for Cube.
I can't find any data regarding the specific heat of Cube at cryogenic temperatures but your data may well be true also for 4K.
At T<400mK heat transport in titanium is strongly suppressed due to its superconducting phase. We therefore strongly recommend Cube as it otherwise may take a while to cool down a set of positioners. Furthermore you will get eddy currents when applying small magnetic fields so you won't get a clean magnetic measurement around OT B-field. At T>400mK there's probably little difference between the two materials.
Please keep in mind that heat transport is also blocked by the ceramic axes used in attocubes Premium Line positioners! Just because the body is conducting well doesn't mean the upper part of the positioner is at base temperature."

What is the difference between /LT and /LT/HV ?;"For older stages before March 2021 when switching to PEEK connectors at all AN* POS and SCN the main differences between the /LT and the /LT/HV positioners are different materials in the wiring and connectors, different materials used in the lubrication, glue, different clamping forces on the guiding rod and additional testing for the LT/HV versions.

We specify the standard low temperature (/LT) version to operate in a pressure range from 1E-4 mbar to ambient pressure, whereas the low temperature/high vacuum (/LT/HV) extends this range down to 1E-8mbar. As the general applicability, we recommend customers to use the standard /LT version if they operate at a pressure higher than 1E-4 mbar before cooling down, even though the cryogenic pressure will be significantly smaller (since outgassing is not an issue at low temperature, the /LT positioner will not worsen the overall pressure). If customers want to achieve high vacuum conditions already at room temperature prior to cool down, then the /LT/HV version is more appropriate.";Semi-internal;AN* Series;
"What’s the maximum pressure and magnetic field ratings?	";attocube /UHV-positioners are specified down to 5 x 10^-11 mbar and the maximum tested magnetic field is currently 39 T (both on customers side).;Public;AN* Series;
What is the temperature range for the positioners? Are they bakeable?;There are different attocube ANP positioners specified from the mK range up to 373 K. All UHV positioners can be baked out up to 423 K.;Public;AN* Series;
"What is meant with ""open loop"" and ""closed loop""?";"The positioners without an encoder are driven in ""open loop"" - those positioners can only be driven forward or backward without an actual readout of the position. Whereas the positioners with an encoder are driven in ""closed loop"" mode, which means that a feedback loop is integrated into the control electronics and minimizes the difference between target position and actual position.";Public;AN* Series;"Further explanation: 
The closed loop positioners I mentioned in the cost estimate have a resistive encoder which allows us to track the displacement of the positioner independent of the number of steps it has taken. This allows you to translate your sample a set distance with a certain resolution. For example, with the /RES encoders I mentioned in a previous email, you can instruct the positioner to translate 200 micrometers +/- 200 nm. The 1-2 micrometer repeatability means that if you translate the x- positioner 500 micrometers in positive x-direction, and then 500 micrometers in the negative x-direction, you will return to the same position in real space within 1-2 micrometers.

An open loop positioner has no encoder, so all displacements are made in terms of a number of steps of the piezo, and then the actual distance the positioner translates then depends on the step size. A typical minimum step size at 4K is 10 nm, but the step size can vary. The step size does mainly depend on the applied voltage: the step size increases with the amplitude of the saw-tooth signal, but it is not an easy relation to define. The step size is not always uniform and depends on the extension of the positioner (where the positioner is in respect to the end of the movement range). Also, the step size differs for the forward and backward motions due to the properties of the piezo. There are additional environment/setup factors that determine the width of a step (e.g. vacuum, temperature, humidity, load conditions, gravity and orientation of the positioners, etc.). This all makes translating a set distance with an open loop positioner tricky."
"What's the meaning of ""fine positioning mode""?";"The fine positioning mode is the ""scan""-mode of our positioners. For that, a DC voltage can be applied to obtain sub-step-size resolution. Please note, the ANGs due not feature such a scan mode.";Public;AN* Series;
Details about the step size?;"
The step size (in the coarse-positioning mode) does mainly depend on the applied voltage: the step size increases with the amplitude of the saw-tooth signal, but it is not an easy relation to define. The step size is not always uniform, this depends on the extension of the positioner (where the positioner is in respect to the end of the movement range). Also, the step size differs for the forward and backward motions due to the properties of the piezo. There are additional environment/setup factors that determine the width of a step (e.g. vacuum, temperature, humidity, load conditions, gravity and orientation of the positioners, etc.).";Public;AN* Series;"Further Information
Unfortunately, we don’t have fixed values which relate the applied voltage with the step size; as the step size depends not only on the voltage and temperature, but also on the specific setup, i.e. applied load, mounting orientation, pressure, etc. It can also vary slightly from one positioner to another since the clamping force we set for each positioner might vary slightly as well.

One can estimate the step size by measuring the time (e.g., with a stop watch) it takes for the positioner to travel the entire range (e.g., 2.5mm for ANPz51), from this you have the travel speed, and the travel speed divided by frequency is the average step size.

Unfortunately, we cannot provide more precise information about this, but the friction based working principle simply doesn’t allow us to be more specific."
What does step repeatability mean?;"The repeatability of step size (in open 0loop mode) means that for a given voltage (and therefore given step size) each individual step may vary in size of up to 5%.

";Public;AN* Series;
How is the behaviour of the /RES encoder at mK temperatures?;"
Please note that we have observed that the resistive encoder shows a temperature dependency at ultra-low temperatures (mK range). At this point one solution is to use the stages at mK in a way that individual steps and DC offset (if needed) are applied, and then you would have to wait until the temperature and hence the position readout stabilizes again. Another possible immediate solution would be to position the stages at more elevated temperatures (e.g. at 4K), ground the stages and then cool down to mK temperatures. The reading of the encoder will still change due to the temperature dependency of the resistive sensor element, but if the controller is not trying to compensate for this “alleged” drift in position the stage will actually remain at the same position as positioned at 4K. For mK applications (or better all applications below 1 or 2 K) the /RES+ encoder is recommended.";Semi-internal;AN* Series;
Why is there an asymmetry in the forward / backward speed of the positioners?;An asymmetry in the forward/backward speed is typical for the slip-stick positioners, since there is an asymmetry in forward and backward step sizes which is typically on the order of 5%. This asymmetry will then also lead to a different speed of the positioner when moving forward/backward with the same voltage/frequency settings.;Public;AN* Series;
Difference between stepping and scanning?;Our stages offer two working different modes: 1) coarse-positioning: here we apply a saw tooth voltage to the piezo which results in slip-stick motion. At room temperature the typical minimum step size is about 50 nm. The step size can be increased by increasing the voltage. In this mode the positioners have a travel range of several mm (up to 50 mm for the ECS3080 for example). 2) fine-positioning: for this mode we apply a DC voltage which now simply expands the piezo. In this mode the range is limited, e.g. 3.5 µm for the ANPx101 @RT. Within this range you can get sub-nm resolution which is only limited by the noise of the electronics.;Public;AN* Series;
What is a piezo drift?;"Piezo drift is a composition of creep & thermal drift.
Thermal drift depends on the change of temperature. The thermal expansion coefficient for a piezo is in the order of 5E-6/K for 300 K and ~4E-3/K for cryogenic environments. Therefore, one can say that minimum changes (especially in ambient conditions) are negligible whereas the cooling down to cryogenic temperatures causes larger (but reproducible) changes in the position.

The respective creep specifications can be found in the spec sheets (e.g. ANSz100: creep = 0.5.. 0.8% per decade of time).";Public;AN* Series;
Can the positioners be used in liquid helium?;"In principle we cannot give any guarantee for our systems when they are directly immersed into liquid Helium. We do have a lot of customers who are successfully using our positioners in liquid Helium, but then it is very important to avoid condensation and ice on the positioners. Condensed ice will reduce the specs of the operation and worse, in the long run when ice melts into water this will oxidize contacts and affect components as well as piezos (current leakage etc.). In case condensation occurs on the positioners we would recommend that after every warm up cycle the remaining fluid is evaporated (e.g. in an oven with a max. temperature of 100°C) before cooling down again.
As you see there are too many parameters outside our control and hence we cannot provide a full guarantee. However we know that customers have been using our equipment directly in liquid Helium for several years now and we don’t have any reports on the degradation of our equipment due to the environmental conditions.";Semi-internal;AN* Series;
Is there a max. wiring resitance for the positioners?;"The total wire resistance all the way from the controller output to the piezo element of the stage and back needs to be as low ohmic as possible in order to ensure the correct and reliable functioning of the stage (via the slip-stick principle). We recommend to keep the total wire resistance for each stage below 2 Ohm, and please note that for closed loop positioners (with the AMC300) 5 Ohm wire resistance should be the absolute max. value of what we can approve (without further testing) for a correct functioning of our stages. If you have any way of lowering the wire resistance it would be beneficial. Also the length should be limited to 5 m (total length from controller to positioner).

"Information on the resonance frequency of the positioners?	";"The resonance frequencies for a specific setup are affected by many factors like e.g. the way of mounting the stages, the load mounted onto the stage(s),…etc. We have tested an ANPxyz101 positioners combination and as you can see in the attached page from our catalog, no resonances in vertical direction occurred below 2.5kHz. For a single ANPx101 (or ANPz101) positioner we have measured the first resonance frequency to be at typically 2kHz, while no load was placed on them (in both cases).

The resonance frequencies for the ANP51 positioners series are however a little bit higher, as you can see on the attached technical note. For instance, the resonance frequency for the ANPz51 positioner (while a load of 25 g is placed on top of it) is ca. 1kHz, while for the ANPz101 (with a similar load on top of it) is clearly below 1 kHz.

Can you explain the different notions of force regarding your positioners' specs?;"In general there are four different specifications regarding force:

Load
- How much load can be put on the positioner when mounted horizontal (x positioner mounted in std. orientation.
- Max. load also can decrease lifetime, speed, etc. and increase particle abrasion
- E.g. ECSx3030 is specified for 90 N, ECSz3030 for 8 N
Lifting Capability
- How much weight a x-positioner can move when mounted vertically (moving against gravity), or a z-positioner horizontally mounted (moving against gravity - as intended)
- E.g. ECSx3030 with 1 N or ECSz3030 with 8 N
Dynamic blocking force
- In most cases the same value as lifting capability
- Dynamic force / output of the piezo drive in x-direction
--> at attocube we define the dynamic drive force which is defined as the lifting capability and dynamic blocking force
- E.g. for ECSx3030 it is 1 N and for ECSz3030 it is 8 N
Static blocking force

Is there an estimate on the total heat impact / thermal dissipation of an EC* Series positioner?;"There are three different sources of heat dissipation in an EC* Series positioner:

1. Heat from piezo activation

Can be estimated using , where C is the piezo capacitance, U the driving voltage, f the driving frequency, and tan(δ) is the loss factor.
The relevant factors depend a bit on the specific operating environment, but typical values are:
C      1.1 µF at ambient conditions
U      20 - 45 V
f      1 - 2 kHz
tan(δ)   1.5 %

This yields an estimate for the heat from piezo activation of ~ 30 - 50 mW.
2. Heat from friction

Can be estimated according to Power equations: P=F⋅x⋅fP=F⋅x⋅f or P=F⋅vP=F⋅v  , where F is the holding force, x the distance, f the driving frequency, and v the velocity.
We estimate the holding force F to lie around 5 N at ambient conditions.
This yields an estimate for the heat from firction of ~ 10 - 20 mW.
3. Heat from position encoder (NUM, NUM+ sensor)

The optoelectric sensor contributes most of the heat to the system.
The NUM sensor is specified with 300 mW
The NUM+ sensor is specified with 50 mW.
Total heat impact

Adding the above sources, one finds the total heat impact of the positioner to lie around
300 - 400 mW with a NUM sensor and 80 - 120 mW with the NUM+ sensor.

Notice that this calculation is a theoretical estimation. Also, it does not factor in any heat dissipation through the cabling.";Public;EC* Series;

A non-gasing/non-evaporating coating (dycronite) is used and they are specified down to 10-11 mbar. This coating is not compatible with our current ECGs and ECRs.

UHV rotators and goniometers:

UHV versions of the rotators and goniometers of our ECS-Series are only specified down to 10-9 mbar and not down to 10-11 mbar as the linear ECS positioners. The limitation is caused by the used grease (Ultratherm). It is not possible built up an ECR without grease. The vapor pressure of the grease is temperature-dependent:

Vapor pressure at 100°C       1 · 10-8 hPa / 7.5 · 10-9 Torr / 1 · 10-8 mbar

If you do have a customer who needs pressure down to 10-11 mbar, please contact ST and we will try our best to find a solution.";Internal;EC* Series;
Are there additional information or specs about the EC* (U)HV fiber glass positioner cable?;"Static: Bending radius of 5mm (R5)

Dynamic: Bending radius of 25mm (R25) but without guarantee (just orientation). The fiber glass cable is not suitable for real dynamic movement, although it is used in stacks that move. The cable has a diameter of approximately 2mm and is very soft, lacking dimensional stability.";Public;EC* Series;
What is the max. ECU cable length? ;"


Currently the max. length is limited to 5m (April 2023).


However, a customization is possible to increase the length to 15m (ask PM). This design improvement will be implemented as a standard within the next months.
";Public;ECU;
Is the ECU ANSI Z540 or ISO17025 compliant?;"
ANSI Z540 is the US standard for calibrations, the european equivalent is the ISO17025.  ISO17025 essentially covers all the requirement of ANSI/NSCL Z540.3 except for Z540.3 Section 5.3 (b)(see also:https://www.transcat.com/iso17025-vs-ansiz540). The reference ECUs are ISO17025 compliant, but not the ones, that calibrated internally.

Is there an Adapter Plate (M15.5x0,5 on SM1) to mount a sensor head with FLEX structure into a standard SM1 Thorlabs mount?;"
Yes, but this article is not yet in our standard portfolio as customers usually don´t need the FLEX structure (M15.5) if they anyway have to use a SM1 kinematic mount. 
Customers can directly buy it from Thorlabs: SM1AD15 - Externally SM1-Threaded Adapter for Ø15 mm Optic, 0.40"" Thick

Are there further potentially useful mounts directly availbale at Thorlabs?;"
In general, Thorlabs offers a magnitude of useful mounts and accessories for our fiber based laser interferometer and we extensively use them internally. However it doesn´t make sense to dublicate large parts of the portfolio (with higher prices), so here are some recommendations which mounts customers can/should directly by at Thorlabs (list will grow):SM1AD15 - Externally SM1-Threaded Adapter for Ø15 mm Optic, 0.40"" Thick5-Axis Kinematic Mount
